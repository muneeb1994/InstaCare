Database for an app to connect the people seeking psychological help with a Psychiatrist.. The primary purpose of this app and database is to connect the people seeking psychological help with a Psychiatrist. This app and database will help the people who are in severe need of help, because every year, thousands of people end up losing their lives to depression and other mental health issues just because they do not receive timely access to healthcare.

It will contain patient’s information, it’s medical history, information regarding different doctors that are available etc. To get started, patients will input their profile details within the app when they sign up, such as their name, their age, as well as location. After signing up, patients will be able to search and schedule an appointment with a doctor for a 30 minute consultation.

Here is an example of how someone will use this app. Jake has been feeling depression and anxiety for a while but now, it has increased so much that he is unable to even step outside his home. He downloads the app and creates an account on it. He is then able to look up different doctors that are available at that time with an open availability. He schedules an appointment to see the doctor right away. He meets the doctor online, tells the doctor about his issue, and the doctor evaluates him, prescribes him some medicines, and asks him to follow up.
